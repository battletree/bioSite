	One of the great influences my father has had on me is his passion for music. I knew going into this interview that most of his free time is spent in his studio playing guitar and creating his own music. Sadly that free time in not as frequent as one might desire. As time progressed, Eugene’s career became the focal point in his life and he now works in Mayo Hospital where he hosts the busiest clinic in the entire organization. Eugene’s shares his passion for music with his patients as he sees himself in each and every one of them. As time progressed Eugene began to see his own mortality in his patients, causing a level of empathy that can’t help but inspire devotion and compassion. Now his job, just as his music are part of his hobbies.
